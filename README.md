The project was created to enhance my skills as a Front-End Developer. The site was built in Webflow with various advanced techniques.

The primary goal is to capture attention and maintain user motivation to scroll to the end. The main trigger is scrolling, aiming to create an illusion of entering another dimension.

The site features: an endless loop, parallax zoom, sticky card elements, horizontal scroll sliders, and scroll-driven animations. Additionally, it is fully responsive for seamless viewing across different devices.
